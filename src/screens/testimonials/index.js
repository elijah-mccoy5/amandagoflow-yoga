I always leave her classes feeling refreshed and ready to take on my days!!

She’s singlehandedly the reason why I stayed in shape as quarantine happened earlier this year. I am grateful for her energy and classes and will continue to take them as long as she’s offering!" <br/>

            "Even at 6am in the morning she connected my mind, body and soul. Got me ready for the day and geez I felt great! Music was always solid. Left me ready to concur all of my own personal challenges no matter the feat.

She knows how to keep a class going with all walks of life. The impact she portrays on all her students is unexplainable.  You just have to take a class and you will know. She’s knowledgeable in what she does so listen and move with her instructions. You will always come back because of how good you feel!" <br/>
